Examples of PaaS include Google App Engine, Heroku, and OpenShift.\n",

    "A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer that can run its own operating system and applications. VMs are created by partitioning the resources of a physical computer into multiple virtual computers, each with its own operating system and applications. This allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical computer, each with its own isolated environmen.\n",

    "When a VM is created, it is allocated a portion of the physical computer’s resources such as CPU, memory, and storage. The VM uses these resources to run its own operating system and applications as if it were running on a physical computer. The VM can also be configured to have its own network interface, allowing it to communicate with other VMs or physical computers on the same network.\n",

Cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform use VMs to provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to their customers."
